# ðŸ“š Scala Library Management System

## Overview
This project is a **mini library management system** written in **Scala**.  
It allows you to manage different document types (**Books**, **Magazines**, **Comics**), register users, and track document borrowing and returns.

This project demonstrates:
- **Object-Oriented Programming** in Scala
- **Traits**, **Abstract Classes**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation** and **State Management**
- **Collections Manipulation**

---

## Features
### âœ… Document Management
- Supports **Book** (with genre), **Magazine** (with edition number), and **Comic** (with series volume).
- Tracks borrow and return status.
- Displays document-specific details.

### âœ… User Management
- Add and list users.
- Borrow and return documents.
- List borrowed documents per user.

### âœ… Library Management
- Maintain a collection of documents and users.
- Add documents/users dynamically.
- List available (not borrowed) documents.

# Scala Library Management Project

## Example `Main.scala`

```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val mylibrary = new Library()
    TestData.allDocs.foreach(mylibrary.addDocument)
    TestUsers.allUsers.foreach(mylibrary.addUser)

    mylibrary.listAvailableDocuments()
    TestData.doc3.infos()

    println("\n\n")
    TestUsers.user1.borrowDocument(TestData.doc3)
    TestUsers.user2.borrowDocument(TestData.doc1)
    TestUsers.user2.borrowDocument(TestData.doc6)
    TestUsers.user4.borrowDocument(TestData.doc3)

    println("\n\n")
    TestUsers.user1.listBorrowedDocuments()

    println("\n\n")
    TestUsers.user1.returnDocument(TestData.doc3)
    println(TestData.doc3.description)
    TestUsers.user4.borrowDocument(TestData.doc3)
    println(TestData.doc3.description)

    println("\n\n")
    TestUsers.user3.borrowDocument(TestData.doc2)

    println("\n\n")
    mylibrary.listAvailableDocuments()
  }
}

```
And here is the output below:
